# House Price Predict

This is a house price prediction model built using the ESP-DL framework, leveraging the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston). This dataset contains features such as the number of rooms, property age, and other attributes that influence housing prices. The model uses deep learning techniques to predict housing prices based on these factors.

Built on the [ESP-DL](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dl) framework, the model is optimized for deployment on embedded devices, making it lightweight and efficient for real-time predictions.
